        <p class="dramatics">This is the story of girl, who tried at coding and drowned in that world. That girl is Kala
            Elam, and that's
            me. At 32, I realized that the best thing to do for myself is to switch careers again, for the third time,
            which is how I found myself in the world of web development.
            To say it is stressful and intimidating is a given, but it's also fun and thrilling and rewarding.</p>
        <p class="dramatics">Many moons ago, I graduated from Texas
            Christian University with my bachelors degree in Speech Pathology and immediately started working as
            a pediatric Speech Therapist. That same year I found yoga and felt joy for the first time in my life, and
            after two years of blood, sweat, pulled muscles, and some zen, I became a certified yoga instructor. </p>
        <p class="dramatics"> It didnt take long for me to need a new thrill in my life, and loving to travel, but
            hating to fly, I
            decided to become a Flight Attendant. I learned to love flying but knew that it was a temporary hiatus from
            real life in the Americas. That is the story of how I ended up in the SMU web development bootcamp,
            trying to make my brain start functioning again after years of sleeplessness and alcohol abuse.</p>
